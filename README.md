# Color Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This repository contains the implementation and experiments of my BS thesis titled **“Color Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)”**, completed at **Karakoram International University, Gilgit (December 2023)**.

## 📌 Overview
Color detection is a fundamental task in computer vision with applications in image processing, robotics, industrial automation, and quality control. This project explores traditional machine learning techniques and deep learning approaches for accurate and robust color detection under varying conditions.

The core focus is on designing and training a **CNN-based model** and comparing its performance with classical approaches such as **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** across different color spaces.

- Develop an automated system for color detection using deep learning  
- Design and train a CNN model for robust color classification  
- Compare CNN performance with traditional ML methods (KNN)  
- Evaluate accuracy and precision across different color models (RGB, CMYK, HSL)

## 🧠 Methods & Technologies
- **Deep Learning:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), ResNet (conceptual analysis)  
- **Machine Learning:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- **Image Processing:** RGB channel separation, histograms  
- **Tools & Libraries:** Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib
